## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

We started by pre-processing the Spotify dataset to prepare it for analysis and modeling. Key features like danceability, energy, loudness, and tempo were selected as predictors, with track_popularity as the target variable. To ensure data quality, missing values were handled by removing incomplete records. The dataset was then split into training (80%) and testing (20%) subsets to train and evaluate the model's performance. Numerical features were standardized using StandardScaler, which normalized the data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This step ensured that all features were on the same scale so one feature wasn‚Äôt overshadowing another. The processed data was then organized into structured variables (X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test) for efficient use in modeling.


### Data Preprocessing
- **Handled Missing Values**: Removed incomplete records
- **Train-Test Split**: 80% training, 20% testing
- **Feature Scaling**: Standardized numerical features using `StandardScaler`
- **Feature Selection**: Focused on `danceability`, `energy`, `loudness`, and `tempo` as predictors for `track_popularity`

### Models Implemented
- Linear Regression (Baseline)
- Random Forest Regression
- XGBoost Regression

## üìà Model Analysis & Results

### Linear Regression
- **MSE**: 591.01 | **RMSE**: 24.31 | **MAE**: 22.32 | **R¬≤**: 0.037
- **Key Insights**:
  - Loudness and danceability were positive predictors
  - Energy showed a negative correlation with popularity
  - Model explained only 3.7% of variance in popularity

### Random Forest Regression

###  Model Implementation
Following our baseline Linear Regression model, we implemented a **Random Forest Regression** to better capture complex patterns in predicting song popularity. This ensemble method offers several advantages for our use case:

- **Handles Non-Linear Relationships**: Effectively captures complex feature interactions
- **Robust to Outliers**: Less sensitive to extreme values that survived preprocessing
- **Reduces Overfitting**: Multiple decision trees with averaging prevent overfitting

###  Model Configuration
- **Estimators**: 100 decision trees
- **Methodology**: Each tree makes independent predictions, with final output averaged across all trees
- **Objective**: Highlight complex, non-linear relationships in the audio feature data

###  Performance Metrics
| Metric | Score | Improvement vs Linear Regression |
|--------|-------|----------------------------------|
| **MSE** | 474.22 | ‚Üì 116.79 |
| **RMSE** | 21.78 | ‚Üì 2.53 |
| **MAE** | 17.05 | ‚Üì 5.27 |
| **R¬≤ Score** | 0.23 | ‚Üë 0.193 |

**Interpretation**: The model showed moderate improvement over Linear Regression, but still only explains **23% of the variance** in song popularity, indicating significant room for improvement.

###  Feature Importance Analysis
One of Random Forest's key advantages is providing clear feature importance metrics:

| Feature | Importance | Interpretation |
|---------|------------|----------------|
| **Tempo** | 28.84% | Most influential - song speed (BPM) plays notable role in listener appeal |
| **Loudness** | 26.47% | Second most important - volume intensity significantly impacts popularity |
| **Energy** | 23.67% | Moderate influence - track intensity affects listener preference |
| **Danceability** | 23.02% | Notable contributor - rhythm and dance appeal matters for popularity |

###  Key Insights
- **Balanced Feature Impact**: All four features show similar importance levels (20-30% range)
- **No Dominant Predictor**: No single audio feature overwhelmingly drives popularity predictions
- **Moderate Explanatory Power**: Combined features explain limited variance, suggesting missing critical factors
- **Model Advancement**: Random Forest outperformed Linear Regression but still fell short of robust predictive capability

> **Conclusion**: While Random Forest provided better performance and valuable feature insights, the limited R¬≤ score underscores the complexity of predicting musical popularity and the need for additional features beyond basic audio characteristics.
